mono

Due to Unity's dependance on mono, Unity-Console uses mono as well.

Some files are copied from the mono tools folders and modified to work with 
unity-console when the defaults do not work the licenses for mono are in 
LICENSE.mono.  The source files copied are marked indicating the license used.

IronLanguages

Some files are copied from the IronLanguages project (IronPython and IronRuby)
to provide base functionality.  Originally the project was envisioned to host 
IronPython in a console but that was not completed.  

Parts related to the Shell scripting in Windows remain.  Those files retain 
the license that pertains to those files.
